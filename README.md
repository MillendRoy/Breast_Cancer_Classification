# Breast_Cancer_Classification
1. Predicting if the cancer diagnosis is benign or malignant based on several observations/features
2. 30 features are used, examples: - radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) - texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) - perimeter - area - smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) - compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) - concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) - concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) - symmetry - fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
3. Datasets are linearly separable using all 30 input features
4. Number of Instances: 569
5. Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign
6. Target class: - Malignant - Benign https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
